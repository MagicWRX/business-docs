## 🎯 Purpose

This document contains an exhaustive list of potential features, enhancements, and capabilities for MXN.CHAT. Features are organized by category and prioritized by phase, difficulty, and business value.

---
## New Feature Development
1. **Vibe Lounge**: Central hub of mxn.chat.
2. **Initial Page**: Displays your Alias selected with its **VIBE indicator**.
3. **Vibe Controls**: User can adjust vibe indicator for that alias OR select the drop down to select one of the users other alias with their own indicator and Settings.
4. **Alias Parameters**: Each Alias has its own controls/settings/boundaries/triggers/parameters. This is ESSENTIAL to mxn.chat to empower User Control.
5. **Main Window**: The Vibe Lounge.
6. **Vibe Navigation**: The vibe lounge displays colored circle vibes/tabs across the top. Users can select colored circle vibes to begin chatting **Anonymously** with all Users, OR jump to **Current Topics**, OR **My Topics** (with unread message indicators).
7. **User Vibe**: Every User starts out with their own Topic/Vibe/wall/place to post their moods and feelings. These are safeguarded by their parameters.
8. **A/B Testing & Environment Control**: Implement a robust system for testing UI variations (Sidebar, Vibe Lounge, Landing Page) and managing Live vs. Staging environments using Vercel Edge Middleware and Supabase Projects. See [MXN_ABTESTING.md](MXN_ABTESTING.md) for details.
