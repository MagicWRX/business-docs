## 1. 🎯 Vision Statement

MXN.CHAT is a lean, secure, fast real-time chat platform designed for:
	•	Private 1:1 and small-group conversations

	•	Backend: Supabase Postgres + Realtime Channels
	•	Auth: Supabase Auth with email verification
	•	Storage: Supabase buckets with strict RLS
	•	Ephemeral Media Logic: Cron-based cleanup via Vercel/Edge Functions
	•	Payments: Stripe (standalone + MagicWRX-integrated)
	•	Analytics: Vercel Web Analytics + optional GA4

## 🔧 Recommended Actions (Based on Dec 11 Review)

### Authentication Debugging
1. **Check Supabase Connection:**
   ```bash
   grep NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL .env.local
   grep NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY .env.local
   ```

2. **Review Auth State Listener:**
   - File: `/src/contexts/ChatContext.tsx`
   - Line: 168 - `supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange()`
   - Add console logging to track auth events

3. **Verify Google OAuth Setup:**
   - Google Cloud Console → Credentials → OAuth 2.0 Client IDs
   - Authorized redirect URIs must include:
     - `http://localhost:3000/auth/v1/callback`
     - `https://mxn-chat-git-develop-magicwrxs-projects.vercel.app/auth/v1/callback`
     - `https://mxn-chat-dcgsy3rde-magicwrxs-projects.vercel.app/auth/v1/callback`
     - `https://mxn.chat/auth/v1/callback`
     - `https://auth.mxn.chat/auth/v1/callback`
     - `https://opcsbfwqazyzsskuuooz.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`

4. **Test Authentication Locally:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/brianlindahl/Development/Business/Websites/mxn-chat
   ./start-local.sh
   # Open http://localhost:3000
   # Try signup with new email
   # Check browser console for errors
   ```

### Email Configuration (CRITICAL)
**Status Check Completed:** December 11, 2025 14:17 CST

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Email SENDING: Working via Brevo API
- ✅ DKIM Records: Already configured and propagated
- ✅ SPF/DMARC: Already configured
- ❌ Email RECEIVING: NOT working (no MX records)

**Immediate Action Required:**

1. **Enable Cloudflare Email Routing (10 minutes):**
   - Go to: https://dash.cloudflare.com → mxn.chat → Email
   - Click: "Enable Email Routing"
   - Add destination: `magicwrxstudio@gmail.com`
   - Verify Gmail address (check inbox for verification email)
   - Create routing rule: `admin@mxn.chat` → `magicwrxstudio@gmail.com`
   - Cloudflare will automatically add MX records

2. **Test Email Receiving:**
   ```bash
   # Send test email from any account to:
   admin@mxn.chat
   
   # Check Gmail inbox:
   magicwrxstudio@gmail.com
   
   # Should arrive within 1-2 minutes
   ```

3. **Verify MX Records:**
   ```bash
   dig MX mxn.chat +short
   # Expected: Cloudflare MX servers (isaac, linda, amir)
   ```

**Complete Setup Guide:** See [MXN_DNS_EMAIL_SETUP.md](MXN_DNS_EMAIL_SETUP.md)

### Testing Priority Order
1. Fix Google OAuth authentication (blocking users)
2. Enable email receiving via Cloudflare Email Routing (10 min)
3. Test invite system (working but verify)
4. Test message posting (working but verify)
5. Test complete user journey end-to-end

### Quick Diagnostic
```bash
# Run comprehensive DNS & Auth check
cd /Users/brianlindahl/Development/Business/Websites/mxn-chat
./check-auth-dns.sh

# Expected output:
# ✅ Email SENDING working
# ✅ DKIM records configured
# ✅ Environment variables set
# ❌ NO MX RECORDS (need Cloudflare Email Routing)
```

4. 🧱 Anti-Drift Safeguards

To ensure long-term consistency:

Stable SSOT Docs

All decisions must be reflected in:
	•	MXN_ROADMAP.md
	•	MXN_BUSINESS_PLAN.md
	•	MXN_TREE.md

Atomic Architecture Rules
	1.	Feature request → reflected in TREE → schema changes → roadmap
	2.	No new tables without updating the schema document
	3.	No new integrations without entering the Integration Map
	4.	MagicWRX integrations must be sandboxed (no entanglement)
	5.	Every architectural change must be versioned

Technical Safeguards
	•	Code generators must reference only SSOT documents
	•	LLM prompts must include: “Use MXN_SSOT Standards”
	•	CI pipeline checks architecture folder

⸻

5. 📦 Completed Deliverables (Running List)
	•	MXN_ROADMAP.md
	•	MXN_BUSINESS_PLAN.md
	•	MXN_TREE.md
	•	MXN_FOUNDATIONS.md
